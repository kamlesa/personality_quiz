# Farmer's Foragables Quiz
Hello!
This is a mini project inspired by the currently trending MBTI quizzes ^-^
Made by Me!!

I have recently been playing a lot of Stardew Valley, and thought that would be a cool setting for my quiz, so a lot of the results and questions will be inspired by the game.

Current Link: NONE.

It is still in progress but stick around!

## How to use

You can use the `make` command to build, run, and more.

Use the command:
`$ make help`

```
make help   : Show this message
make run    : Start the server
make build  : Build the "main" executable in the current directory
make clean  : Cleans the Golang workspace
make test   : Runs tests
make docker : Builds the Docker image and starts a container
```
